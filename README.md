Master’s Projects and Exam Work at NHH
=====================================

This repository showcases selected projects and code developed during my Master’s degree at the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH), where I specialized in Business Analytics.
The only exception is FIN11, which was completed during my bachelor’s degree.

This README is organized into two categories:

1. Courses with school exams
2. Courses with term papers or Master’s thesis

## School Exams


### BAN400 — R Programming for Data Science

Grade: A

Average grade: C

Learning outcomes:
- Proficiency in R and tidyverse
- Data wrangling and visualization

Comments:
A very good course that helped me realize that I want to work with coding and data science in the future.



### BAN404 — Statistical Learning
Grade: A

Average grade: C

Learning outcomes:
- Core machine learning methods, including:
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine

Comments:
I liked the course and hope I can use what I learned in a future job.


### BAN438 — Application Development in Python
Grade: B

Average grade: B

Learning outcomes:
- Building interactive dashboards using Dash for Python
- Structuring Python applications for visualization and user interaction

Comments:
A fun course with a stressfull exam. I have later used this knowledge to build an app, which is also available on my GitHub: *https://github.com/eirikroka/Football-Sim*.

## Projects


### FIN11 — Trading and Market Microstructure

Grade: A

Average grade: B

Project summary:
We wrote a research paper analyzing whether merger arbitrage strategies produced higher returns than the S&P 500 in the U.S. market from 2010 to 2022.

Main findings:
- Total returns were lower than the S&P 500
- Risk-adjusted performance was significantly better

Comments:
This was my first coding project. We worked in a team of four, and I was responsible for all the coding. The workload was very high for a bachelor course worth only 7.5 ECTS. I tried using ChatGPT at the time, but it wasn’t good enough yet to be very helpful.


### ENE434 — Energy Industry Analytics

Grade: B

Average grade: B

Project summary:
We applied classification methods from BAN404 to predict whether electricity prices in Bergen (NO5) would be highly volatile seven days ahead.

Main findings:
- Classification methods can be used for prediction of volatiliy, but without the right data and sufficient data quality, the models will not perform well.

Comments:

### Master thesis
Grade: A

Average grade: A

Project summary:
We looked at whether it was possible to make a reliable profit from Home/Draw/Away and Asian Handicap football betting.

Main findings:
- It was possible to earn a consistent profit from Asian Handicap betting in the Premier League during the pandemic, while no other period or market showed similar robustness.
