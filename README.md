Master’s Projects and Exam Work at NHH
=====================================

This repository showcases selected projects and code developed during my Master’s degree at the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH), where I specialized in Business Analytics.
The only exception is FIN11, which was completed during my bachelor’s degree.

This README is organized into two categories:

1. Courses with school exams
2. Courses with term papers or Master’s thesis

## School Exams


### BAN400 — R Programming for Data Science

Grade: A

Average grade: C

Learning outcomes:
- Proficiency in R and tidyverse
- Data wrangling and visualization

Comments:
A very good course that helped me realize that I want to work with coding and data science in the future.



### BAN404 — Statistical Learning
Grade: A

Average grade: C

Learning outcomes:
- Core machine learning methods, including:
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine

Comments:
I liked the course and hope I can use what I learned in a future job.


### BAN438 — Application Development in Python
Grade: B

Average grade: B

Learning outcomes:
- Building interactive dashboards using Dash for Python
- Structuring Python applications for visualization and user interaction

Comments:
A fun course with a stressfull exam. I have later used this knowledge to build an app, *which is also available on my GitHub.*

## Projects


### FIN11 — Trading and Market Microstructure

Grade: A

Average grade: B

Project summary:
We wrote a research paper analyzing whether merger arbitrage strategies produced higher returns than the S&P 500 in the U.S. market from 2010 to 2022

Main findings:
- Total returns were lower than the S&P 500
- Risk-adjusted performance was significantly better

Comments:
This was my first coding project. We worked in a team of four, and I was responsible for all the coding. The workload was very high for a bachelor course worth only 7.5 ECTS. I tried using ChatGPT at the time, but it wasn’t good enough yet to be very helpful.


### ENE434 — Energy Industry Analytics

Grade: B

Average grade: B

Project summary:
We applied classification methods from BAN404 to predict whether electricity prices in Bergen (NO5) would be highly volatile seven days ahead.

Main findings:
- Classification methods can be used for prediction of volatiliy, but without the right data and sufficient data quality, the models will not perform well.

Comments:

### Master thesis
Grade: A

Average grade: A

Project summary:
We looked at whether it was possible to make a reliable profit from Home/Draw/Away and Asian Handicap football betting.

Main findings:
- It was possible to earn a consistent profit from Asian Handicap betting in the Premier League during the pandemic, while no other period or market showed similar robustness.

Schooll Exams:

* BAN400: R Programming for Data Science:
*   Grade : A, proportion A this year:
*   Learnings outcomes: Gotten really vell versed in R, and the tidyverse universe
*   Thoughts: This was a fantasic subject, i really like it, and this course help me in finding out that i want to work with coding and hopefully data science in the furture

* BAN404: Statcial Learing:
* Grade : A, proportion A this year:
* Learning outcomes: We learned a lot of machine learning methods, like Support Vector Machine, K-nearst neigbour, Random Forest and so on. 
* Thoughts: Intereserting subject, something i want to learn more about and hopefully use in later in job and so on.
  
* BAN438: Application Development in Python
* Grade : B, proportion A this year:
* Learning outcomes: Use of python to build visuled in DASH, it similar to other visualing "verktøy" like Shiny and Flask
* Thoughts: Fun course, and a very stressfull exam, used this knowledge to make an app, I have it her on my GitHub. 

Projects:

* FIN11: Trading and Market Microstructure
* Grade : A, proportion A this year:
* Short about the paper: We wrote a paper where we analysed if you earn more money on merger arbitrage than in the SP500 in the US.
* We found the total return to be worse than the US, but that the sharp ratio was much better. 
* Thoughts:This course was actuall in my bachelors degree, but I have included it her since it was my first real introduction to coding.
*  This course was super challeging, I used eqaully much time on this course than the three other subjects combined. It felt like we wrote a bachelore thesis in a 7,5 ECTS subject, 
*   the project was done by a team of 4, but i did all the coding and i didn't know a thing about it before it and
*    i rember tyring to use chat but chat was so bad at the time at it could not help me.
* 

* ENE434: Energy Indusrty Analytics
* Grade : A, proportion A this year:
* Short about the paper: We used classification methods learned in BAN404, to try to categorise 7 days into future on wheter the electricty prices in Bergen (NO5) where higly volatile or not,
* based on historical prices, wheter and water magsins.
* Thoughts: Funny to try to use the methods used in BAN404, to try and do predictions, learned that data quality is very important.
